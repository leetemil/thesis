## Questions for Novo Nordisk

### Data:
- How much data? What are the dimensions? *Answer:* There is a lot. It consists of images of particles in samples. Some of it is glass, some is dust, some is actual components of the product.

- Is the data labelled? Classed? Multiclassed? *Answer:* The data is not labelled, but they are working on it, and should be ready with some labelled data once we start. At least that is the plan..
- Does it have a time-component (time-series data)? *Answer:* No, not really.

### Expert:
- Do you have a data scientist expert? Does he have time to supervise? *Answer:* There is a guy called Gopal http://image.diku.dk/gopal/ who will be working on this, and will have time to function as a supervisor at NN. We did not talk to him.
- Will he be able to guide us through the data? *Answer:* We think so. We did not talk to him.
- Do you already have some ideas for what to do? What have you already tried? *Answer:* Not sure.

### Practical Aspects:
- Meetings: When/where? Once a week at NN.
- Can we take data outside NN? Yes
- We are going to need good hardware; will this be a problem? No. they are looking for a cloud solution.
- Open-source code. The code we write is going to be public; will this be a problem? This is probably a problem; they have a legal team that will look at the contract.
- Publishing results. Is this an option? Does public data exist? Again, legal team.


## Critical factors:
- We should have a data-expert from NN available during the work (supervisor at NN).
- We should be able to work with (at least some) data at DIKU/outside NN.
- Publication/open-source results.
