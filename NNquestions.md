## Questions for Novo Nordisk

### Data:
- How much data? What are the dimensions?
- Is the data labelled? Classed? Multiclassed?
- Does it have a time-component (time-series data)?

### Expert:
- Do you have a data scientist expert? Does he have time to supervise?
- Will he be able to guide us through the data?
- Do you already have some ideas for what to do? What have you already tried?

### Practical Aspects:
- Meetings: When/where?
- Can we take data outside NN?
- We are going to need good hardware; will this be a problem?
- Open-source code. The code we write is going to be public; will this be a problem?
- Publishing results. Is this an option? Does public data exist?


## Critical factors:
- We should have a data-expert from NN available during the work (supervisor at NN).
- We should be able to work with (at least some) data at DIKU/outside NN.
- Publication/open-source results.
