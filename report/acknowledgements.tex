We would like to thank our supervisor on this thesis, Wouter Krogh Boomsma. This thesis (like most, we imagine) was not without its ups and downs, but Wouter always managed to steer us in the right direction, both with regards to theoretical considerations and our own stress levels. Wouter also suggested that we should apply for the Novo Scholarship 2020, which we would not have received otherwise.

We thank Novo Nordisk and Novozymes, who supported this thesis with 84.000 DKK through the Novo Scholarship Programme, a scholarship given to exceptional students to allow them to fully dedicate their time to their theses. In addition to the financial aid, we were put in contact with mentors from both companies: Daniele Granata and Alexander Junge from Novo Nordisk and Dennis Pultz from Novozymes, all of whom we thank for their guidance and advice.

Building and reproducing models from papers can be a nontrivial task in itself. We thank Aaron Kollasch and Deborah S. Marks at the Debora Marks Lab, Harvard Medical School, for kindly answering our questions in times of need and for making their data and work open source.

Finally, we would like to thank the many people behind The Universal Protein Resource (UniProt) consortium. Without their dedication and initiative to maintain an open and accessible protein resource database, any of the experiments in this thesis would have been unlikely to exist.
